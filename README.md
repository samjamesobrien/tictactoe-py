# Coding Challenge

Use the tests to implement the empty methods.

PyCharm works well with this repo and allows break-pointing.

## 1. Implement the Game class

We have a [Game](/src/game.py) and associated [GameTest](/tests/game_test.py).

1. Implement the `_get_all_possible_lines` method
2. We can now implement the `_get_winner` method

## 2. Implement the ComputerPlayer class

We have a [ComputerPlayer](/src/computer_player.py) and associated [ComputerPlayerTest](/tests/computer_player_test.py).

1. Implement the `_get_blocking_move` method
2. Implement the `_get_winning_move` method
